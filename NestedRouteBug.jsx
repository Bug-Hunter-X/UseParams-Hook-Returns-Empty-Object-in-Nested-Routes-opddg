In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component nested deeply within other route components.  If the parent route components do not have a `Route` element to match the URL path segment for the nested component, the `useParams` hook in the nested component might return an empty object, even if the URL matches the expected pattern. This happens because the router's path matching process may not reach the deeply nested components. For instance, if the URL is '/users/123/profile' and the parent component only has routes for '/users', the '/123/profile' path segment will never be reached by the nested component, leading to an empty `useParams` object.
