This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6 where the useParams hook returns an empty object when used within deeply nested components. The bug arises when parent routes lack the necessary Route elements to match the URL path segments leading to the nested component.  The solution involves adding appropriate Route components in parent routes to ensure the path matching process correctly reaches the nested components, allowing useParams to function as expected.
